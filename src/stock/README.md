# Stock Predictor
This is a stock market prediction game.
The user is given some fake currency, and is then allowed to make fake investments into real stocks using that money.
The goal is to learn how to predict the variation of stocks, in order to turn a (fake) profit.

The stock data is pulled from the last 100 days of a real stock, and is obtained with API AlphaVantage.
