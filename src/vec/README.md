#Epicycle Drawing Tool
This is a tool made to draw a picture using an epicycle.
The user provides the program with a Connect-the-Dots picture, which will then be drawn by an epicycle.

The epicycle itself is a combination of many vectors of varying lengths rotating at various frequencies, which are then added tip-to-tail to create the epicycle.
The correct lengths and frequencies of the vectors are found using the Discrete Fourier Transform.
