# Circuit Simulator
This is a circuit simulation tool.
You can place wires, resistors, batteries, switches, and light-bulbs.
With these components, you can create a circuit and observe its behavior.

The different voltages and currents are found by using Kirchhoff's Laws in order to generate a system of equations, which is then solves using matrices.
