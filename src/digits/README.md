# Neural Network
This is a neural network made to learn to recognize handwritten digits.
Using backpropagation calculus, it finds out, for every connection, whether the connection's weight needs to be increased or decreased.
From this, the network increases its accuracy, and decreases its cost, which represents how much the network's guess deviates from the correct answer.

The network itself is of the form of a fully connected layer, without any convolutional or pooling layers.
This program is made to help visualize the network's learning, and to allow to user to customize the learning.
